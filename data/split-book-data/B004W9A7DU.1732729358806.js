window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The ultimate secret. The ultimate agent. Nathaniel Cade returns.</p> <p>For 140 years, Nathaniel Cade has been the president's vampire, sworn to protect and serve his country. Cade's existence is the most closely guarded of White House secrets: a superhuman covert agent who is the last line of defense against nightmare scenarios of which ordinary citizens only dream. When a new outbreak of an ancient evil - one that he has seen before - comes to light, Cade and his human handler, Zach Barrows, must track down its source. To \"protect and serve\" often means settling old scores and confronting new betrayals...as only a centuries-old predator can. </p>";
