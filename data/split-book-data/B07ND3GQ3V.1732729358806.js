window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>There can be no victory without sacrifice. </p> <p>The Iron Wolves are a company of legionnaires whose legendary exploits date back to the Savage Wars. When they are invited to be guests of honor at a ceremony on a small, backwater planet, they look forward to some precious time away from the constant conflicts of galaxy's edge. </p> <p>But when a neighboring country invades, disrupting the ceremony and killing innocents, the Wolves are forced to make an impossible decision. Aid a people pleading for their protection...or obey the cynical orders of their senate to stand down and see how the dust settles. </p> <p>Taking their careers and lives into their hands, the Iron Wolves and local militia form a brotherhood determined to fight for what they believe in. War is on the wind, the battle is at hand, and the Legion is on the move once more. </p> <p>Strap on your bucket, grab your blaster, and start listening today. The Iron Wolves call, and death is on the hunt.</p>";
