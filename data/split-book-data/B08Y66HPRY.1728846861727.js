window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Death Waits in the Dark: Six Guns Don't Miss</i> is a thrilling story about a Night Stalker at war. This is the story of an attack helicopter pilot who flew with the renowned 160th Special Operations Regiment (Airborne), and the incredible friendships Greg Coker and his fellow compatriots forged in the heat of combat. </p> <p>The Night Stalkers, officially known as the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, are the best helicopter pilots and crews in the world. These are the crews who fly America’s top special operations units to combat. They can reach any target, plus or minus 30 seconds, as they take pride in saying. The Battle of Mogadishu, the Osama bin Laden mission, and the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi raid are just some of their exploits that have made it through to the public. When you hear about special operations troops doing something incredible on the ground, it's almost always because 160th SOAR pilots like Gregory \"Gravy\" Coker flew them in, provided air support, and whisked them back out - all under cover of darkness. </p> <p>Alexander Hollings writes: \"The 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, commonly called the Night Stalkers, are widely considered to be among the best military aviators on the planet. Coker's new book, <i>Death Waits in the Dark: Six Guns Don't Miss</i> promises to give us a glimpse into this elite and secretive world, and came with some help from Sandboxx's own resident Delta Force legend, George E. Hand, IV.\"</p> <p>All of my proceeds will be donated to multiple non-profits that support veterans, first responders, and their families.</p>";
