window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>When art mimics life, somebody’s going to get what’s coming to them.</b></p> <p>Henry Lindon's flight across the north Atlantic was turbulent and sleepless. His plane has just touched down in Amsterdam, where he’s come to work as a visiting professor. Lindon is torn about leaving his troubled wife, Marylou, behind in Dallas, but relieved and excited to start a new chapter in a lively city. The taxi drops him off at an elegant building at Roetersstraat 8-1, where he’s greeted by his university liaison and soon-to-be neighbor, the lovely and spunky art professor Bernadette Gordon. After settling into his apartment, Lindon changes clothes and sets out to explore canals and cafés, wondering what the dinner invitation from Bernadette means for his fresh start.</p> <p>But troubles from the past soon cross the Atlantic. Lindon discovers that notorious Dutch art forger Han van Meegeren, born in 1899, is about to play a part in Lindon’s own personal drama. With evil closing in, Lindon, Bernadette, and Marylou find that secrets of the art world may hold the key to settling old scores and putting a predator away for good.</p> <p>Whether you are familiar with the world of Henry Lindon from author Clay Small’s first book, <i>Heels over Head</i>, or this is your introduction to his works, you’re in for an exciting and unusual international adventure with characters that will live on in your memory long after you’ve finished the book.</p>";
