window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The greatest conflict the galaxy has ever known....</b></p> <p>They were the Savages. Raiders from our distant past. Elites who left Earth to create tailor-made utopias aboard the massive lighthuggers that crawled through the darkness between the stars. But the people they left behind on a dying planet didn't perish in the dystopian nightmare the Savages had themselves created: they thrived, discovering faster-than-light technology and using it to colonize the galaxy ahead of the Savages, forming fantastic new civilizations that surpassed the wildest dreams of Old Earth. </p> <p><i>Until the Savages came in from the Darkness.... </i></p> <p>When a Savage hulk lands on glittering New Vega, one of the crown jewels of the post-Earth galaxy, a coalition of planetary governments amasses their forces to respond to the post-human Savage Marines who've come to sack and enslave. But what the coalition forces find is something far more sinister than the typical Savage hit-and-run: this time, the Savages have come to stay.</p> <p>Witness the intense beginning of The Savage Wars, the epic conflict, built into the lore of Galaxy's Edge, that will encompass over a thousand years of brutal fighting. Only the greatest military force in the galaxy can bring this war to an end...and the galaxy will never again be the same. </p> <p>Experience the beginning of the Legion. Experience the Savage Wars.</p> <p>Featuring an unforgettable performance by Stephen Lang (<i>Avatar, Gods &amp; Generals</i>), Jason Anspach and Nick Cole explore the thrilling, desperate, and brutal war that forever shapes the galaxy....</p>";
