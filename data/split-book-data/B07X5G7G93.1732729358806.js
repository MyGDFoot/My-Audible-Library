window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Even in the fortress of the night watch there is no safety to be found. An indomitable power is stirring, and it has set its awful gaze upon the young Warden, Lillin. Where can she run when the world is crumbling beneath her feet, and the ones chasing her are far more powerful than she can ever hope to be? The struggle might be hopeless, but Lillin is a Warden of Will, and she will not be beaten down. Even if she must march headlong into the abyss, she will do as she must to gain the strength she needs to win.</p> <p><i>Warden's Fall</i> is the third novel in the Tyranny Cycle series and follows the continued adventure of a spirited young woman named Lillin as she brushes off her youth and becomes something more than she'd ever hoped to be. The author's fusion of horror and fantasy is a masterful and unique exploration of the dark fantasy genre, and one that can both disturb and touch the listener in surprising ways. With traces of H. P. Lovecraft and Clive Barker woven together seamlessly with the sort of fantasy you'd find in a David Gemmel or Gene Wolfe book, you will find yourself transported to a place where fancy and fear play equally with your imagination.</p> <p>Heath Pfaff is the author of The Hungering Saga (an Amazon top 10 best-seller in fantasy) and the Chaos Awakens trilogy, two series that have both received accolades for their unique and exciting takes on the fantasy genre. The Tyranny Cycle is yet another fantastic exploration of moral quandary and adventure, and is arguably his best work to date. If you're a fan of either fantasy or horror, you owe it to yourself to give this series a listen. You won't be disappointed.</p>";
