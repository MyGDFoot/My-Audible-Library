In just over half a year he's gone from the weakest cadet at school to one of the strongest in his class, and there's no one left who would argue that his Device, Shido, isn't the most terrifying CAD they've ever laid eyes on. Still, Rei knows that his climb has barely begun, like he knows that the <i>true</i> fight is only just starting.</p> <p>After all… The Sectionals tournament has arrived.</p> <p>Rei, along with Aria, Viv, Catcher, and a couple unexpected squadmates, are about to face the first real battle of their careers.

As ever, though, their journey is hardly bound to be a smooth one.</p> <p>Especially not when Rei and Aria begin to suspect that Shido may be even more formidable than it appears, much less as the powerful entities who've already taken notice of the 'Iron Prince of Galens' begin to make their moves, some casting their hands in his favor, others very much against…</p>";
