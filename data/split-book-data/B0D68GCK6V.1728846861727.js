window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Cursed. Broken. Possibly Insane.</b></p> <p>Nyx was born Hollow. An empty vessel in a world of spirits. Normally, that was a death sentence, yet somehow he survived. He's always been stubborn like that.</p> <p>He's also always been a bit crazy. Which is why, in another life, he did something reckless. He sent himself a message—his memories. Threw them into the Flow from which all spirits return.</p> <p>Besides, Nyx believed in asking hard questions. Like, was reincarnation real? Would this half-ass plan actually work? And if it did, could his life really get any worse?</p> <p>Turns out…it could.</p> <p><b>What to expect:</b></p> <p>A different sort of reincarnation story—one that isn't so easy. A crazy protagonist. Slow burn to OP power progression. Loot-based skill modification system. Infused spirit items. Crafting. Bromance. Couple's therapy. Murder Babies. Oh, and an interdimensional death wagon. Honestly, reincarnation never looked so crazy.</p>";
