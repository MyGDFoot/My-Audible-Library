For 15-year-old Wisty and her older brother, Whit, life turns upside-down when they are hauled out of bed one night, separated from their parents, and thrown into a secret compound for no reason they can comprehend, except that the new government is clearly trying to suppress Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. <p>Imprisoned together in a decrepit cell, Wisty and Whit cling to the only things they have left - a blank book, a drum stick, and each other. While searching for ways to escape, both begin exhibiting strange abilities. Maybe there <i>is</i> a reason they were singled out! </p> <p>Can Wisty and Whit, a witch and a wizard, master their skills in time to save themselves, their parents - and maybe the world?</p> <p>From James Patterson, the creator of the best-selling Maximum Ride and Daniel X novels, comes <i>Witch and Wizard</i>, his most terrifying and awe-inspiring series yet.</p>";
