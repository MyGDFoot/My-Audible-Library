window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Becoming a warden was an almost insurmountable task that pushed Lillin down a dark and winding path, but all of her training did little enough to prepare her for what was to come from beyond the walls of Black Mark. An insidious force moves, taking shape in the shadows and it rides on the winds of madness and misery. Lillin must struggle with her own lack of control over her abilities if she wishes to make a stand, but against such a terrible force, can anyone truly hold their ground?</p> <p><i>Warden's Path</i>, the sequel to <i>Warden's Will</i>, is the second novel in the Tyranny Cycle series by Heath Pfaff, author of the Chaos Awakens trilogy and The Hungering Saga. He has had multiple books appear in Amazon's top 10 fantasy rankings and is well known for his dark and sometimes horrific fantasy stories.</p> <p>If you enjoy the works of authors like David Gemmel, H. P. Lovecraft, Brent Weeks, Clive Barker, and Brandon Sanderson then Pfaff's books may well appeal to you. His writing is dark, grim, and accessible, and his fantasy worlds are both engaging and full of strange and terrible places to explore.</p>";
