And still, the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances.</p> <p>The Rider and his dragon have come further than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to AlagaÃ«sia?
