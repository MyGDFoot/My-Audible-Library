window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Wild satire.... The feckless protagonist, Arthur Dent, is reminiscent of Vonnegut heroes.” (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</p> <p>The unhappy inhabitants of planet Krikkit are sick of looking at the night sky above their heads - so they plan to destroy it. The universe, that is. Now only five individuals stand between the killer robots of Krikkit and their goal of total annihilation. </p> <p>They are Arthur Dent, a mild-mannered space and time traveler who tries to learn how to fly by throwing himself at the ground and missing; Ford Prefect, his best friend, who decides to go insane to see if he likes it; Slartibartfast, the indomitable vice president of the Campaign for Real Time, who travels in a ship powered by irrational behavior; Zaphod Beeblebrox, the two-headed, three-armed ex-president of the galaxy; and Trillian, the sexy space cadet who is torn between a persistent Thunder God and a very depressed Beeblebrox.</p> <p>How will it all end? Will it end? Only this stalwart crew knows as they try to avert \"universal\" Armageddon and save life as we know it - and don't know it!</p> <p>“Adams is one of those rare treasures: an author who, one senses, has as much fun writing as one has reading.” (<i>Arizona Daily Star</i>)</p>";
