window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Leave no man behind.</b> </p> <p>On Detron, a simmering protest boils over and turns deadly when militants hiding among the demonstrators deliberately shoot down a group of legionnaires, executing one survivor and taking two for ransom. The only Republic asset the captured leejes can rely on is a lone marine sniper who defies orders in a desperate attempt to save them. </p> <p><b>But a troubled sea of hostile riots, looting, and murder is too much for anyone to navigate safely. </b> </p> <p>Except Tyrus Rechs. Following a trail that links the riots and deaths to a demagogue known in the underground as Madame Guillotine, the bounty hunter must fight his way above, beneath, and through the sweltering city to bring the prisoners back homeâ€¦and make those responsible pay. </p> <p><i>Join the adventure as Tyrus Rechs stops at nothing to take down a nefarious conspiracy before it has a chance to take root in the very Republic that wants him dead.</i> </p>";
