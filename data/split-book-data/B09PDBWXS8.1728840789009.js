David 00472 is one of those daily service attendants that must obey the commands of the two AI overlords. David becomes a person of interest to Angela as she helps him to improve the quality of his life. David, suspicious and fearful of her sudden concern for him, is cautious about her true intent. Malcolm, ever watchful of all humans, is unsure why David 00472 has become Angela’s pet project. Is this part of their cruelty? Do they delight in using humans for their amusement somehow?</p> <p>David meets a man, another human service attendant, who will change and challenge his notion of freedom and what it truly means to be free.</p>";
