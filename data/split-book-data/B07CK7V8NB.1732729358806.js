With Miri and her team of extracted heroes still on the run, Mother, the disgraced former head of the British Secret Service, has other ideas.... </p> <p>While Mother retreats to her bunker to plot her next move, Miri, Ben, Safa and Harry travel far into the future to ensure that they have prevented the apocalypse. But what they find just doesn't make sense. </p> <p>London in 2111 is on the brink of annihilation. What's more, the timelines have been twisted. Folded in on each other.

With nothing left to lose but life itself, our heroes must stop Mother - or die trying. </p>";
