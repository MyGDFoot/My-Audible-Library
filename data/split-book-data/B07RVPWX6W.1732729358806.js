Cause of death - a mystery. The lone survivor - a man, raving like a lunatic, wearing only a deerstalker hat. </p> <p>Now, the man who calls himself Sherman Holmes is being studied like a lab rat by a top-secret government agency. How is it he can be barely clinging to reality one minute - yet be a seeming genius the next?
