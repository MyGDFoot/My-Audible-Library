He was Hermes Trismegistus, and as the scribe of the gods of ancient Egypt, he possessed all divine knowledge... which he passed on to humanity, though only those who have been tutored in its wonders can fully understand it.In this extraordinary 1912 book, three secret initiates to his teachings - who remain anonymous to this day - share their insight with all who seek to understand the mysterious underpinnings of the universe and our relationship with it. </p> <p>An appreciation of Hermeticism, as the basis of all paranormal philosophies still studied today, is an absolute must for anyone fascinated by magic, the supernatural, and the wisdom of the ancients. </p>";
